Here’s a complete, optimized Replit AI prompt you can use to make the app you described. It clearly defines both functional and design requirements so Replit AI can generate a working prototype accurately.  

***

**Prompt for Replit AI:**

```
Build a full-stack web app for **Anurag University Sports Complex Availability Tracker**.

### App Purpose:
The app tracks real-time availability of all sports courts and allows users to check in and check out based on availability. It should ensure that each check-in lasts a maximum of 1 hour unless the user checks out earlier.

### Features & Functionality:
1. Display all available sports courts with real-time status:
   - 2 Badminton courts
   - 2 Volleyball courts
   - 5 Carrom boards
   - 2 Basketball courts
   - 1 Football field
   - 1 Tennis court

2. Each court/board should show whether it is:
   - Available (green indicator)
   - Occupied (red indicator)

3. When an available court is clicked, the user can “Check In.”  
   - Once checked in, that court should immediately change to “Busy.”
   - Automatically start a 1-hour timer for that user.  
   - After 1 hour, show a notification reminding the user to check out.

4. If the user checks out before 1 hour, the slot immediately becomes “Available” again.

5. All availability changes should instantly reflect across the app (use real-time sync using Firebase or any lightweight backend).

6. Display total counts of available vs total courts for each sport.

### UI Design:
- Follow Anurag University’s branding:
  - Dominant colors: White background
  - Secondary colors: Vibrant Red (#E50914) and Blue (#0033A0)
- Use a clean, modern layout with responsive design.
- Include buttons or tabs to switch between sports categories.
- Each court should appear as a card showing:
  - Sport name
  - Court number
  - Status (Available/Busy)
  - Check-In or Check-Out button depending on status.
- Add a small notification section or popup for automatic reminders.

### Tech Stack Recommendation:
- Frontend: React.js (with Tailwind CSS using the given color scheme)
- Backend: Node.js + Express
- Database / Real-time sync: Firebase Realtime Database or Firestore
- Hosting: Replit server environment

### Goal:
Generate fully functional code with all frontend, backend, and database components connected. The app should be ready to run directly on Replit with live update functionality.

Would you like this prompt to focus on a **web interface**, or should it instead generate a **mobile app (React Native or Flutter)** version?
