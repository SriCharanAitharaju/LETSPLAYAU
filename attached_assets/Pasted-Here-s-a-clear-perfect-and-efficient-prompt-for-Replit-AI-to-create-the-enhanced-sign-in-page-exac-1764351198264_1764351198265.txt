Here's a clear, perfect, and efficient prompt for Replit AI to create the enhanced sign-in page exactly as specified:

```
Create a single-page user-friendly sign-in for Anurag University students with these EXACT requirements:

1. SINGLE PAGE with TWO clear options side-by-side:
   - "Sign in with Google" button (use Replit Auth/Google OAuth)
   - Email/Password form (email MUST end with "@anurag.edu.in")

2. VALIDATION RULES:
   - Email: Only accept @anurag.edu.in domain, clear error if invalid
   - Password: Standard validation, no weak passwords
   - Google sign-in: Auto-validate domain server-side

3. PERFECT USER FLOW:
   - Both methods → Validate → Success → Redirect to dashboard
   - Show "Welcome, [Student Name from email]!" on dashboard
   - ZERO technical glitches or errors during login

4. SCALABILITY & RELIABILITY:
   - Handle 100+ simultaneous logins without crashes
   - Real-time database updates: Mark user as "logged_in: true" 
   - Show live user count/status in admin dashboard

5. TECHNICAL SPECS:
   - Frontend: React/Next.js with Tailwind CSS
   - Backend: Node.js/Express + PostgreSQL (or Replit DB)
   - Authentication: Replit Auth + JWT fallback
   - Real-time: Use Socket.io or Supabase for live updates

6. UI/UX:
   - Clean, mobile-responsive design
   - Anurag University colors (vibrant red, blue, white)
   - Loading spinners during login
   - Success/error messages in plain English

Make it PRODUCTION-READY with no bugs. Deploy automatically. Test with 5 sample @anurag.edu.in emails.
