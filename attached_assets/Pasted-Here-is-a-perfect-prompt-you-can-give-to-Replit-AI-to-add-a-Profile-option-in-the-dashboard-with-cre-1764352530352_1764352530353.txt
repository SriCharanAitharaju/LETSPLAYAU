Here is a perfect prompt you can give to Replit AI to add a Profile option in the dashboard with creative and user-friendly buttons:

***
Add a Profile section in the student dashboard with the following features:

1. Profile menu accessible from the dashboard sidebar or top-right corner click.
2. Under Profile, include clear, attractive buttons:
   - History: Show past activities/login history
   - Theme: Allow switching between light/dark mode and color themes
   - Settings: Manage password, notification preferences
   - Help/Support: Quick access to FAQs or contact support
   - Logout button
3. Use intuitive icons on buttons for quick recognition (e.g., clock for History, palette for Theme).
4. Keep layout clean and mobile-friendly for easy navigation.
5. Use Anurag University colors (red, blue, white) and highlight hovered buttons for interactivity.
6. Add smooth transitions or subtle animations on button clicks for a modern feel.

Make this Profile dropdown or sidebar expandable/collapsible so the user can focus on main dashboard content easily. The design should be inviting, simple, and elegant for students.

This creates an engaging personalized experience with all key personal options at one place.
